CREATING VIDEOS
Jeff Thompson | 2017 | jeffreythompson.org

Running a sketch as an app is often all you need, but sometimes
you want to render the sketch's output to video. You might want
to do this to document a software project, or you've written
a sketch for the purpose of creating a cool animation or motion
graphic.

We have two options for rendering video...

MOVIE MAKER
Processing's built-in Movie Maker tool makes it easy to
create videos from a folder of images (and you can add
sound too!). 

1. Run this sketch to render the files
2. Open Tools > Movie Maker...
3. Select your images and output settings and hit "Create movie..."

Using the "Animation" or "PNG" compression will give really nice
results for crisp graphics, but will result in really big video
files. JPG gives much smaller files, with the tradeoff of quality.

FFMPEG
A slightly more complex but way more powerful tool, ffmpeg
runs from the command line. It can take a folder of images
and write to a wide variety of movie file types, codecs, 
and other settings. This is great when you want lots of control
over a video's look, or you have unique considerations in your
video like preserving sharp pixels or lots of movement.

A typical ffmpeg command looks like this:
ffmpeg -y -r 24 -i %04d.png -vcodec png MySuperCoolVideo.mov
