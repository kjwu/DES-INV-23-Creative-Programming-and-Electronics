PYTHAGORAS TREE: LINES
Jeff Thompson | 2017 | jeffreythompson.org

A classic fractal, the Pythagoras tree uses a simple recusive
function. Like all fractals, when the variables are changed
slightly, the results vary widely.

This recursion is hard to follow mentally, but the metaphor of
a tree is apt: as the function is called, it branches and branches
and branches. When the exit condition is reached, it returns to
where it left off and continues down the opposite branch.

CHALLENGES:
1. Try changing the variables below, and the reduction formula
   to see how the tree changes. Can you start to predict what
   will happen when you make a change?
2. Try modifying the code so that the right and left branches are
   different.
3. Can you make the color of the branches change as well? (Hint:
   use the box size and map() to drive the changes.)
4. Can you make the tree more realistic? Can you add leaves?

void branch(float len) {
  
  // move to the top of the previous line

  // reduce the line length each time the
  // function is called – try changing this
  // and swee how it changes the tree!
  len *= 0.6;
  
  // classically, this would be the formula used
  // len *= 0.5 * sqrt(2);
  
  // if the size is too small, stop
  if (len < minLen) {
    return;
  }
  
  // rotate left
  pushMatrix();            // local transformations
  rotate( radians(45) );   // rotate branch
  line(0,0, 0,-len);       // draw the line
  branch(len);             // recursively call this function
  popMatrix();
  
  // rotate right
  pushMatrix();            // ditto for the right side
  rotate( radians(-45) );  // note we rotate by a negative angle
  line(0,0, 0,-len);
